            <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

            <p>Every place is saturated with waves. Radio broadcasts, WiFi handshakes, cellular pings, ambient vibrations, the hum of infrastructure, voices, wind, machines. Most of it is inaudible or ignored &mdash; electromagnetic noise, background radiation, the sonic residue of a location at a specific moment. Oh My Ondas captures all of it and turns it into music.</p>

            <p>"Ondas" means waves in Spanish. Sound waves, radio waves, the waves of a place. The name is the concept.</p>

            <h2>What it actually does</h2>

            <p>The instrument reads the full wave spectrum of a location: microphone input, piezo vibration sensors, FM radio, WiFi signal characteristics, GPS coordinates. An AI composition engine analyzes this material and uses it <em>as</em> the components of a composition &mdash; not layered sequentially on top of a beat, but structurally transformed. Workers drilling outside become the rhythmic backbone. A microphone captures traffic hum and the synth reshapes it into a bass drone. A radio broadcast fragment becomes a melodic phrase. WiFi interference patterns become granular texture. The subtractive synth generates tones tuned to the spectral characteristics of the ambient sound &mdash; the place itself sets the harmonic palette. The composition is <em>of</em> the place, not just <em>at</em> the place.</p>

            <p>Three modes of operation: <strong>Picture</strong> takes a snapshot of the sonic environment at a moment. <strong>Soundscape</strong> generates an AI composition from the captured waves. <strong>Interact</strong> lets you perform live on top of either &mdash; an 8-track sequencer, sampler with 8 pads, subtractive synth, effects chain (delay, granular, glitch, bitcrush). Every pattern is tagged with GPS coordinates and a timestamp. Take the instrument to a different corner and you get a different piece. The composition is unrepeatable because the source material only existed right there, right then.</p>

            <h2>Why it matters</h2>

            <p>Marc Aug&eacute; described the proliferation of <em>non-places</em> &mdash; airports, highways, shopping malls &mdash; spaces of transience that supposedly lack identity, relation, and history. But every non-place is actually dense with waves. The electromagnetic spectrum of a motorway rest stop is as unique as a fingerprint: the specific combination of radio stations, cellular towers, WiFi networks, mechanical vibrations, ambient acoustics. Oh My Ondas reveals that no place is truly anonymous. Even the most generic space has a sonic identity waiting to be heard.</p>

            <p>The Italian architecture collective <a href="https://stalkerlab.wixsite.com/spontaneamente" target="_blank">Stalker</a> (Lorenzo Romito, Francesco Careri, and others) spent decades walking through Rome's <em>Territori Attuali</em> &mdash; abandoned, marginal, interstitial urban spaces that fall between the cracks of planned development. Ignasi de Sol&agrave;-Morales called these spaces <em>terrain vague</em>, noting that the French word <em>vague</em> means not only "void" and "uncertain" but also "wave." The terrain vague is literally a terrain of waves. Stalker's practice of transurbance &mdash; crossing these territories on foot, listening, attending to what is overlooked &mdash; extends naturally to the electromagnetic dimension. Oh My Ondas is an instrument for sonic transurbance.</p>

            <p>R. Murray Schafer's acoustic ecology gave us the concept of the <em>soundmark</em> &mdash; a community sound unique enough to deserve protection, the sonic equivalent of a landmark. Christina Kubisch's <em>Electrical Walks</em> proved that every city has an equally unique electromagnetic soundscape. This instrument combines both: it reads the full spectrum of a place and composes from it, creating a soundmark that is simultaneously acoustic and electromagnetic, natural and artificial, found and generated.</p>

            <h2>How it's built</h2>

            <p>The interface maps directly to physical controls &mdash; no menus, no dropdowns, everything is a button you can hit with your thumb. Fill effects use hold-to-activate like hardware drum machines. The location binding isn't a feature added on top; it's the core architecture. Hardware specs, BOM, and pin assignments are documented on the <a href="design.html">Design</a> page. Development process, CI/CD, and testing strategy are on the <a href="sdlc.html">SDLC</a> page.</p>
