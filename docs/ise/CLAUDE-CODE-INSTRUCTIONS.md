# 📋 PART 2: CHALLENGER PRESENTATION MATERIALS

## 2.1 Core Messaging

### One-Liner:
```
Oh My Ondas is a sonic camera — capturing environmental sounds and creating music that proves where and when it was made.
```

### 30-Second Pitch:
```
Oh My Ondas is a professional music instrument that creates compositions cryptographically bound to specific locations and moments. Unlike traditional audio tools, every recording proves where and when it was made — imagine a camera for sound that creates unrepeatable sonic artifacts. We have a working web demo you can try right now, and we're looking for partners in museums, media, and events to create unique authenticated audio experiences.
```

### 2-Minute Pitch:
```
Thank you for meeting. I'm [NAME], creator of Oh My Ondas.

THE PROBLEM: In an age of AI-generated content, proving authenticity is increasingly valuable. For museums, events, and media producers, there's no easy way to create audio experiences provably tied to specific places and moments.

OUR SOLUTION: Oh My Ondas is a professional portable instrument that captures environmental sounds and transforms them into musical compositions — with cryptographic proof of exactly where and when they were created.

HOW IT WORKS: We combine 8 audio sources — microphones, radio, sensors — with a professional sequencer, AI assistance, and GPS binding. Every recording embeds its location, timestamp, and conditions.

WORKING NOW: Unlike concepts, you can try Oh My Ondas right now at alevm.github.io/oh-my-ondas. Full 8-track sequencer, synthesizer, effects, AI patterns — all working.

THE ASK: We're looking for pilot partners — museums wanting unique visitor experiences, media producers needing verified location audio, or event organizers creating memorable sonic moments.

Can I show you a quick demo?
```

## 2.6 Pricing Framework (If Asked)

| Offering | Price Range | Includes |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Demo/Workshop | €500-1,500 | Half-day demonstration |
| 2-Week Pilot | €3,000-5,000 | Setup, customization, support |
| 1-Month Pilot | €6,000-10,000 | Full deployment, iterations |
| Custom Integration | €15,000-30,000 | API development, training |
| Annual License | €5,000-15,000/yr | Ongoing use, updates |

**Response to "How much?":**
```
"It depends on scope. A pilot to test the concept is typically €3-5K for two weeks. If it works, we discuss larger integration. I'm flexible for the right partner."
```

---

## 2.7 FAQ / Objection Handling

**"Is this a real company?"**
```
"I'm an independent developer based in Barcelona. For a pilot, I can invoice as freelance or set up a company quickly if needed. The technology is real and working — that's what matters for a proof of concept."
```

**"The hardware isn't ready?"**
```
"The web version has full functionality — that's actually an advantage. No installation, works on any device, easier to deploy. Hardware version adds portability but isn't required for a pilot."
```

**"Why should we work with a solo developer?"**
```
"You get direct access to the creator, fast iterations, and flexible terms. No corporate bureaucracy. For a pilot, that's ideal. If we scale, I'll build a team."
```

**"What about IP/ownership?"**
```
"The core technology is mine. You'd get a license for your use case. Any custom features we develop together, we can discuss ownership — I'm open to fair arrangements."
```

**"This seems niche..."**
```
"Location-authenticated content is becoming essential as AI-generated media proliferates. We're early, which means partnership opportunity, not competition."
```
